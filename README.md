# redis-based-document-search-engine

========================

**Architecture**
- RediSearch https://oss.redislabs.com/redisearch/
	- I used the docker container for the ease of setting up, this is an open source full-text search engine developed by Redis Labs.
- FosRestBundle 
	- useful bundle for handling restful APIs
- ApiDoc
    - useful for generating api documentation and a sandbox

There are 3 key files: 

- AppBundle\Controller\DocumentApiController
    - used to handle requests and provide a restful interface
- AppBundle\Entity\Document
    - used to describe the Document entity, [ has an Identifier and Contents ]
- AppBundle\Util\RedisDocumentHelper
    - used to connect to RediSearch, issue commands with a simple and clear interface


**How to Set up**
- I included a Vagrant provisioning script to prepare an environment with 
    - PHP7.1
    - Apache2
    - RedisSearch ( Running on Docker )
- make sure you have "VirtualBox" and "Vagrant" installed, afterwards :
    - run "vagrant up" within the root directory
    - navigate to http://localhost:8080 and you'll find the ApiDoc page
    - note: this clones the project inside the vagrant box, I did it this way to improve the performance of the project, you need to set up file sync between your IDE and the vagrant box, you can use vagrant@localhost:2222, password 'vagrant' to access the files through sftp
